  "description": "Hey! My name is <strong>Valentin</strong>, I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona. <br/><br/> I've been building web applications for more than <strong>7 years</strong> now with technologies like <strong>React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Javascript and Typescript</strong>. As you may have already noticed my expertise is mainly focused in the frontend side but I can also add to that tech stack <strong>RESTful APIs, NodeJs</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>, I would say I'm more like 80% Frontend 20% Backend.<br/><br/>Currently I work for a big observability platform where I develop and maintain user-centered features for a new generation of the product the company is planning to release soon. Me and my team are owners of a vertical slice of the product, that means we are responible from end to end, going through the design, planning, implemetation, integration, testing and deployment. <br/><br/>Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email at <i>valentin.g.l@gmail.com.</i>"
